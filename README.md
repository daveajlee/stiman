With a touch of an iPhone or Apple Watch, STiMan starts or stops the time for a particular activity.

STiMan has the following goals:
* Support multiple categories such as work or Kindergarten.
* Track the amount of hours and minutes that has passed between the user pressing the start and stop buttons for a particular day.
* Take an amount for a week and calculate how much of these hours have been used.
* The above can be fulfilled with an easy interface with minimal buttons or presses on either an iPhone or Apple Watch.

STiMan has two components. An iOS App which provides the functionality for an iPhone. An Watch App which provides the functionality for an Apple Watch.

### iOS App

The iOS App is coming soon and can be built via XCode.

### WatchOS App

The WatchOS App is coming soon and can be built via XCode.
